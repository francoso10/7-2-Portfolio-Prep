# 7-2-Portfolio-Prep
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  // The task was to develop an advising assistance program for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The application needed to read course data from a file, store it and provide an interface to load data, print course lists, and show detailed course information with prerequisites efficiently.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  // Understanding the requirements was my first step in approaching the problem that helped me in selecting the best data structure. These structures are important since they impace how data is managaed. Choosing the right data structure in our case would ensure those using our program would have quick access to course information. 
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  // I overcame roadblocks through debugging and testing. Using pseudocode helped map everying out clearly and it helped identify and potential problem areas early. 
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  // I learned to break down any problems. This project showed me the value of planning and using pseudocode to outline logic before coding. It also helped me better understand and the importance of data structures.  
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  // This project has improved my coding practices. It helped me further focus on writing maintainable and readable code. Structuring the program into functions made the code modular and easier to debug and extend.
